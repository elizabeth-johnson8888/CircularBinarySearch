# CircularBinarySearch
Lab for Advanced Algorithms class
## Lab Description:
Given a circularly sorted list and a query integer q, find the index of q in the list by implementing a recursive binary search algorithm. If the query integer is not found in the circular array, return -1. The algorithm runs in O(log n) time.

## Run the Lab:
On Windows:
- type [input file] | python CircularBinarySearch.py
